# EK210_Room_Occupancy_Monitor
This is the code I wrote as a part of my EK210 (Engineering Design) team. The code is for a room occupancy monitor, which uses an Arduino Uno R3 to run, using 2 Infared Sensors, and a motor and buzzer are used as methods of alerting users that the room capacity has been reached. The project was done during the Spring 2024 semester.
